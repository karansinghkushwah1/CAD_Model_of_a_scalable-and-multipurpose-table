## DATA
1. The dimensions of the table is 48 in * 24 in (length * width) and with adjustable height whose minimum height can be 29 inches and maximum height can be 35 inches. The table can be adjusted at 4 different heights as per confort of the user that can at 29 inches, 31.5 inches, 33inches and 35 inches.
2. Material used for the upper part of the table is Cherry Wood with Density 900 kg/m3.
3. Total weight of the table is - 28.74 pounds

## Specification -
1. Foldable - This table is easy to fold, which helps the consumer carry it easily from one position to another. Also, it gives more space to the consumer.
